In previous years, I'd usually set different goals for myself--Career, Spiritual, Physical, and maybe Financial. But in 2023, the only thing that rings as better for a "specific goal" is building a better relationship with God.

Of course, I have other general goals like "create more contents", "grow in my career", and so on, but specifically, I want to be more focused on my spiritual life. As I believe that, by getting this right, others will come along. [Matt 6:33](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/111/mat.6.33) says:

> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well

## Journey so far in my Spiritual Life

My journey so far isn't bad, but I know there's room for a lot of improvement. In terms of service and love (towards the church and to people around), I'm trying. But one place I really need to grow is in spending more time with God's word and praying.

In 2022, I took some steps to grow in these areas such as:

* consistently going through [YouVersion daily devotional](https://www.bible.com/verse-of-the-day)
* after some time, I wanted to read the Bible more, so I started with a chapter--Acts
* joining a community of Christians
* praying every morning (either a short one commiting the day to God, or interceding for a friend, e.t.c)

I found a church, which provided the community I wanted. That was nice. For the first and second action points, I was getting it right and excited also, but it became a struggle to keep up. Then I started doing it seldomly, and then even stopped. Then I asked myself:

"I used to be excited about this, how come I found it hard and stopped?"

Over the past few months, I've learned the importance of **having structures to help me build habits**. Excitement can only help you build habits up until a certain point, but structures (and discipline) are what help you maintain those habits.

So for 2023, I've thought of some structures that can help me build the habit of reading the Bible more and praying. I'm sharing this here, not just as a thought, but to also help anyone who's looking for steps they can take to build their spiritual life.

## 1. Getting an Accountability Partner

In 2022, I sought a Christian community, as I had greatly lacked one since graduating from school in 2020. I found it in 2022, but this year, I've realized an accountability partner would also help.

The community I currently have makes me accountable though. But I figured that having someone closer could help me grow better. Someone I can be accountable to with my learnings, and progress, and I can also learn from. It could look like a mentorship role, but not necessarily that close.

I've reached out to a friend, who has spent a couple of years learning and understanding the word of God, as my accountability partner. Thankfully, he has some time and can commit to following up with me. I'm really excited for this, and where this would lead in my journey.

## 2. Reading the Bible with context

One of the things that discourages me from reading the Bible is that I get confused. A chapter starts off nice, and the next thing I'm like "when did we get here?". And usually, I'll be "waiting for the Holy Spirit to explain what a verse or chapter means to me". Then I don't hear from the Holy Spirit, I jump to another chapter, come across the same confusion, and get discouraged.

I don't like this. I really want to get to a point where I **ENJOY** reading the Bible.

That's why I usually depend on devotionals as someone has already done the "thought-work" and I can learn directly from them.

But I've learned recently that while reading from people can be great, and easier, learning and having an understanding of your own from scriptures is important. In fact, I believe that the purpose of devotionals, or existing "processed-thoughts" is to guide one to have their understanding as they read (or even, verify) from the Bible.

So to improve my Bible-reading efforts, I've chosen to start reading the Bible with context. Context means that instead of just reading a particular verse, and trying to make meaning out of fit that resonates with me, or waiting for the Holy Spirit to explain that verse, I'll try to learn what the context of the verse means. How do I do that? By going through the whole chapter. And to better understand the context of a chapter, I may even have to go through the whole book.

So what I want to do now is:

* pick a Book from the Bible
* read from chapter 1, taking notes of as much as I can (where Peter walked, who Paul was speaking to, my learnings, e.t.c)
* go to chapter 2, still remembering what chapter 1 said
* go to chapter 20, still remember what chapter 1 said

While doing this, I also note down the questions I have along the way. Maybe such questions will be clarified before the end of the chapter, in another chapter, or I could ask my accountability partner.

As I've gotten to understand, however, reading the Bible is a lot of work, especially with understanding different contexts, and spending more time than planned on a particular chapter because of the different references you have to understand. But it's worth it. I believe it would help my understanding of God and my prayer life better.

## 3. Making a fixed time for my efforts

In the past few months, I've learned again that I engage myself with a lot of things, which takes a lot of my time, and then makes me tired whenever I want to do some reading or praying. What I've discovered is that whenever I plan my time well, I find time to do the other things I'd like to do.

So what I plan to do this year is to be more disciplined with my time planning. I will try to ensure that I've done all that I need to do--write articles, make videos, take my piano or Duolingo lessons, and so on--for the day before 11PM. By **11PM**, I start with prayer, then I read my bible. Whatever I don't get to finish before that time, I do it after I'm done with my study time, or I do it the next day.

I'd love to study the Bible in the morning but I've seen that I still feel sleepy and not full active. I'd still start my day with words of prayer, and maybe a bible verse from YouVersion. But study, would be in the evenings.

I'll be starting this today, the 8th of January, and I'll see how it goes. I'll update this article, or create another article where I show my progress, and the adjustments I make along the way.

My accountability partner, to whom I mentioned this plan, instructed that I pray for at least 15mins (as a start). He gave me some scriptures I could get prayer points. 15mins is too much for a start for me ðŸ˜‚ so I pleaded and pleaded (yes I did...I love that He wants me to be disciplined though), and we finally agreed to 10mins. So from 11PM, prayer, the reading my Bible.

After this, I should be preparing for bed, or maybe I could few things (like watch a short movie) before.

## 4. Reading Books, Playing Gospel Music, Listening to Messages

### Reading Books

I'm not one for books. I've always tried to adopt the reading habit, but I think a lack of structure and discipline has made that difficult. Well, I'm taking another attempt at it again. I got gifted a book on **Emotional Healthy Spirituality", which prompted me to take reading seriously. What structure do I have on it?

Well, still down to time. I could do this reading anytime in the day (on the train, at a random time in the afternoon) but if I don't get to do it during the day, I will try to round up other things I need to do before 10:30PM-ish. So I can read it, before my prayer and bible study time.

If I cannot be 11PM, then it's one of those things that would come after my study.

Another structure I have is committing to at least one page one day. Not needing to overwhelm myself, but just adopting the habit of reading.

### Playing Gospel Music

I grew up with gospel music, but somehow, I found myself enjoying a lot of Afro Music, Rap, and Secular songs. In 2022, I had the desire to spend more time with Gospel Music, and my Spotify Wrapped showed that I indeed, achieved that desire. I was so happy to see that even though I still listened to secular music, I listened to Gospel Music.

Well, it's 2023, and I'm doing better at spending more time on Gospel. How am I going about this?

I'm exploring more Gospels artists and new songs. Currently, I'm spending time songs by [Maverick City Music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/58r1rB5t3VF5X6yXGPequV?si=FnDRcFxWSQadZ-aeZyuFew), [Elevation Worship](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3YCKuqpv9nCsIhJ2v8SMix?si=LSWLSic9SsmhHZL0HI4k6g), [Housefires](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6egyCFgiJ1j941PaxKoWJD?si=hxudtJDhThms4XKzC4etFQ) and [UPPERROOM](https://open.spotify.com/artist/107CG0UhUl9GJnPwF83N63?si=dBrFXjOIRSSMQaeFja8tAQ) to name some.

I also have a [Chill Worship playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ICONSv6WH7boDV2wtMglw?si=6ad895a1ee614ee0) where I add some songs I'd love to listen to again. You can check it out. I have a good compilation there.

Also, a structure I've set is to listen to these songs as much as possible. I have them playing on my AirPods when I'm going out alone, or on my TV while I go about my day. Some songs get my attention and I develop an interest in the lyrics, and some others just work as background music.

Overall, I'm trying to quench the desire for certain secular music, and develop an atmosphere of worship and Gospel that exists most of the time.

### Listening to Messages

Hmm...this is something I'm not used to. I enjoy listening to messages when I go to church but going back to listen to an already broadcasted message is something I find so hard. But recently, I'm learning to build a habit of this.

Currently, I occasionally go to [Celebration Church Int'l YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CelebrationChurchNG/videos), led by Pastor Iren, a man of God I respect. I enjoy and learn from his messages a lot. So sometimes, I go there to watch videos.

My accountability partner has also mentioned that he'll be sharing messages for me to listen to. Hmm....let's see how that journey goes. I'll be optimistic ðŸ«£

## Wrap Up

Hopefully, there are a few things for you to pick from here if you're reading this. I pray my plans here inspire you to also take some steps toward building a better relationship with God.

I'll update this article as needed because I'm still figuring out what will work for me. Have a blessed year!
