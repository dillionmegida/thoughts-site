Christmas is a day (or season) where you celebrate the birth of Christ. But, what does that mean to you?

> This article doesn't contain facts on whether 25th is actually Jesus' birthday by the way

Here I am, writing this piece on Christmas Eve, and will most likely be done with it by midnight, spanning into 25th, but I found myself thinking recently "What does Christmas mean to me actually?"

A season where I get to eat nice foods and chicken? Where I get to meet friends and those who've been away for a while and now back?

A season to be with family and make memories? Just another day like others? What makes it special?

In the last few years, Christmas has felt really different. I grew up, of course knowing that Christmas is the celebration of Jesus' birth, but I was more focused on the "activities that happened" rather than "the celebrant" in the season. For examples:

* going to church in my "Christmas clothe" (either new, or one of my favorites)
* cooking and sharing food for our neighbors
* going to church in the morning, singing hymns, and back home to eat "Christmas food"
* friends to visit

So whenever the Christmas is approaching, I begin to think:

* what clothe will I wear to church on that day?
* what is mum going to cook?
* which of my friends will be around that I can visit?

But I got to spend less Christmas with family after going to the university. I spent it in school with the very few friends and pastors from church.

Last year was my first time doing the Christmas outside the country, in Netherlands where I now live. My covid results came positive on that same day so I was on quarantine till the 1st of this year.

Even if my covid results were negative, I didn't know anyone here, so I would have still being on my own. Christmas passed by last year and it felt like I didn't even "acknowledge" it. But lately, I've realized that the reason why Christmas was beginning to feel sort of less, was because I was no longer experiencing the occassion around it that I was used to.

Well, it's 2022, the Christmas season is here, and I'm like "do I just let it pass by again?". I got to do a few things in church on Christmas Eve--dancing and singing in church, and dinner with friends. These are all beautiful, but it still gets me thinking; what does Christmas mean to me exactly? It surely is more than these.

Well, obviously, Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Christ. But, leaving the occassion attached to it for a second, it's actually the **BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOR**. The one who died for me, paid the debts for my sins, makes it possible for me to be able to have a relationship with God. It's the birth of the man that SAVED me. We're celebrating that man in this season.

Reminding myself of this is important because now I have friends that I can hang out with unlike last year. There's a lot of singing, and celebration, but I shouldn't forget exactly why I'm celebrating.

So how do I celebrate? Amongst others, doing things that makes the celebrant happy should be the priority. There are many ways I can make the celebrant happy, but for me, most importantly, how I celebrate should include sharing the love of Christ, the celebrant, with my neighbors.

Sharing this love with my family, my friends, people far from me, strangers on the internet or around my home--making them feel loved in this season, putting a smile on their face or just doing something out of a kind heart for them. All of these, I believe, would be a very nice birthday gift to the Celebrant.

The birth of the celebrant, in fact, makes it even possible for me to do all these things in love.

## Wrap up

Amidst the jingle bells, partying, and other forms of celebration that comes with this season, I think it's important that we set our hearts and focus right, not on the activities involved in the celebration, but why we are actually celebrating. It's for the birth of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

So with this piece, I urge you to ask yourself "What does Christmas mean to me?"

Also, share the love of our Saviour with those around you, in any capacity you can. Do that as a gift for the Celebrant ðŸ˜‰

Merry Christmas to you ðŸŽ‰
